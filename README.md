# Factory Space Stations (v0.0.1)

**This mod is an early release. Make backups before using it. Feedback very welcome but not yet complete.**

This is a mod for Dyson Sphere Program. It adds lategame structures that act as factories without consuming
valuable buildspace (and UPS!) on planets. They consume all the resources (machines, sorters, belts, etc) you'd
need to lay them out by hand, but because they are single structures they consume far less processing resources.
This comes at a high extra resource cost and is intended as a way to keep end-game universes going without low
UPS numbers.

Due to Logistics Network code limitations, right now you place these structures on the surface of Gas Giant and 
Ice Giant planets. In future they're likely to be able to move, grow and orbit their stars individually.

## Basic intro

Here's how you deploy a factory:

  - Start producing Construction Units, a new item type added by this mod and quite expensive
  - Use those to produce Factory Space Stations, also new in this mod and also quite expensive
  - Fly to a Gas Giant (or Ice Giant) and place the Factory Space Station anywhere

Once placed, click the Factory Space Station and select the recipe you want it to produce. It will then request
about as many of the machine type, sorters, belts etc that you would have needed to produce 240/s of the item.
It also requests even more resources for constructing a larger space station able to hold all those new
production lines.
