# Factory Space Stations (v0.0.2)

**This mod is an beta release. Make backups before using it. Feedback very welcome as it continues to improve.**

Dyson Sphere Program gets slow in endgame. UPS declines as you place hundreds of thousands of assemblers.
It's frustrating. Factory Space Stations tries to solve that, without being truly cheaty, and while making
more use of outer space.

This mod introduces the Factory Space Station building. Place it on a gas giant, tell it what recipe you
want to build, and it will request all the buildings you'd have used to make a factory manually. It'll also
request lots of frames and turbines to build a larger space station to fit your factory.

Once construction finishes it'll produce 240 items/second, the equivalent of 8 blue belts. But it's not cheap:
producing one of these takes a lot of resources, and it's firmly an endgame option. Even powering one is hard:
they request antimatter rods, and use a lot of energy.

Due to Logistics Network code limitations, right now you place these structures on the surface of Gas Giant and 
Ice Giant planets. In future they'll have better visuals be able to move into outer space.

## Basic intro

Here's how you deploy a factory:

  - Start producing Construction Units, a new item type added by this mod and quite expensive
  - Use those to produce Factory Space Stations, also new in this mod and also quite expensive
  - Fly to a Gas Giant (or Ice Giant) and place the Factory Space Station anywhere
  - Once placed, click the Factory Space Station and select the recipe you want it to produce

Here's what happens next:

  - The Factory Space Station will use the logistics network to request at least as many of the machine type, 
    sorters, belts etc that you would have used to produce 240/s of the item on a planet. It also requests
    frames and turbines to enlarge the space station
  - Once all resources have been delivered, production begins. It then functions just like a production line
    would on a normal planet, requesting inputs over the logistics network and shipping out outputs.
